                <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Royalpalm International College has moved beyond the limit of our students to only class activities by introducing new ideas to accomplish already existing entrepreneurship programme in our school. It is a&nbsp; programme that has been equipping the learners the needed skills to be self-employed, regardless of their profession in the future and even now.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to give the learners variety of choice, we make sure that the skill acquisition is divided into seven (7) sections with competent facilitators monitoring the affairs of each section.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below are the sections available under RCS Entrepreneurship Programme.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cosmetics</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shoe making</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hair styling</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bag making</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cake baking and decoration</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make up and Tying of Gele</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bead making</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Nigeria of today, self-employment has dominated everywhere and RCS cannot hesitate to move in line with what is happening globally. That is why we considered the programme as an additional way of preparing our students for the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, we have been receiving a lot of testimonies from our students on how they have been deploying the knowledge they have acquired under this programme to produce products on their own and sell them to the general public. We do not only tutor them, we also strive better to evaluate them based on what they have learnt at the end of the term to ascertain their level of assimilation. The learners are eager to learn more about the programme because of our commitment to making sure that every single learner stands out in his or her area of specialization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To cap it up, we are teaching the students how to combine other factors of production in order to enhance performance, and that is why RCS is the best among other schools. We hope to serve our students more with the introduction of new ideas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long live RCS!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long live Kwara State!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long live Nigeria!!!</span></p>

                <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some might think educating boys and girls in separate schools or environment is the better option. Others, however, believe that educating boys and girls in the same school enable both parties to benefit a lot. An opinion I have chosen to stand by is that a mixed school has more benefits and advantages to a separate or rather gender schools.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A legendary quote by Johnny Dewey says and I quote, ‚ÄúEducation is a social process, Education is growth, Education is not a preparation for life, but life itself‚Äù. The concept co-Education in schools is the best environment for a child to learn not only how to be academically smart but also to learn how to be alive. Co-Ed school helps a child to learn how to effectively communicate with the opposite sex. This is not only to build or strengthen their bond with each other but also help them in work cultures where they regularly have to face colleagues and bosses or impersonators. Also, when people or in this context students, interact with the opposite sex on daily basis, they learn not only to respect each other but also understand each other‚Äôs perspective and way of thinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students are more open to receive more access to diversity in a mixed school. When students of all ages have access to diversity in both genders in their educational environment, then their personal grades and progress is typically better. Having access to various perspectives and experiences creates more opportunities and reduces the mental efforts of students to try to understand future situations. Since both boys and girls are always ready to develop their skills and personality, when boys and girls are given access to each other at an earlier stage in a secured environment, like the school, then it makes it easier to adapt to changing conditions and acquiring skills while developing their personality to make it easier when they get older.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The co-Educational environment also bridges the equality gap. Our world has made a lot of efforts towards gender equality in the past. By creating mixed schools that offer equal opportunities to both genders, it helps to prove that both genders are equal and there is none better than the other. No one receives special treatment simply because they are boys or girls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelson Mandela said and I quote, ‚ÄúEducation is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world‚Äù. Education is the weapon for change, while mixed gender schools creates the situation for gaining knowledge on proper implementation of this weapon. Mixed gender schools can prepare students for the real world, it prepares students to be able to use this weapon when the situation arises in the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although, there are some advantages to consider with a same gender school [especially for boys] when considering class availability, personal interactions and acceptance, mixed gender schools provide more preparation for what will happen in real life. The average student interact with individuals from all gender identification throughout their day. It also helps to develop better communication skills.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking back, co-Ed schools has help build a suitable individual for our society by not only making them comfortable with the opposite sexes in day to day life but also teaches then to respect and understand each other‚Äôs problems. There could be incidence of Eve-teasing in co-Ed schools, but it‚Äôs the responsibility of the school and family to stand by the victim firmly against such crimes. In my opinion, mixed schools will do more good than harm to the children of our society.¬†¬†</span></p>

                <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning a new language opens up a world of career, personal and business opportunities; French is a good language to learn since it is used by many people worldwide.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, in almost all countries of the world, people learn French language. It is the sixth most spoken language in the world and its speakers currently exceed 220 million throughout all five continents. Aside, English language, French is the second leading foreign language that people learn globally.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A close look at Nigeria‚Äôs geographical location shows that Nigeria is surrounded by Francophone countries i.e French speaking countries. French language is spoken in five continents of the world and Africa is the continent that has most French speakers in the world.¬†</span></p>
<p><b><i>A language for the job market:¬†</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you like to gain access to an international organization for your internship or job opportunities? Then, you should be aware that French is an official and working language for most reputable international institutions. Some of them are United Nations, the European Union, the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), World Health Organization (WHO), the international Olympic Committee, etc. whatever career path you choose, you will be sought after in any of these organizations if you speak French.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowledge of French language, gives you a better advantage of both local and international job markets. There are French companies scattered around the world including Nigeria, French language will make you stand out among others when being considered for a job.¬†</span></p>
<p><b><i>A language for higher education:¬†</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many good reasons to want to study in France as a Nigerian student. Higher education and business schools in France are among the best in Europe and the entire global scene. If you can understand French language so well, you will stand a chance to benefit from numerous grants and scholarship opportunities from French Government. Also, tuition for international students studying in higher institutions in France is among the lowest in Europe, this is because France is one of the few countries that have heavily subsidized tertiary education. You can as well choose to study in countries where French is spoken like Canada, Switzerland, Belgium etc.¬†</span></p>
<p><b><i>It is a world language</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As stated earlier, there is virtually no country in the world where there are no French language speakers. A total of 77 countries make up the International Organization of French speaking Countries (OIF). In the process of learning French language, you can also boost your vocabulary level in English as about 60% of English vocabularies are derived from French.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion, at RCS, we encourage our students to learn French language, learning French will no doubt be a great advantage to them. The more grounded they are in French, the more it will boost their career development as well as open up good job opportunities¬† in whatever work space they find themselves. </span></p>
